# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly and interactive quiz application that:

1. Provides a seamless user experience
2. Tests users' knowledge in various subjects
3. Displays accurate scores and feedback

# Key Activities
The following key activities were performed during the development of the Quiz Application Project:

1. Design and Planning: Designed the application's layout, user interface, and user experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Planned the quiz question flow, scoring system, and feedback mechanism.
2. Quiz Question Management: Created an array of quiz questions and answers in JavaScript. Defined the quiz categories, questions, options, and correct answers.
3. User Input Handling: Implemented event listeners to handle user input, such as selecting answers and submitting the quiz. Used JavaScript to track user responses and update the application state.
4. Score Calculation and Feedback: Developed a scoring system to calculate users' scores based on their answers. Provided feedback on correct and incorrect answers using JavaScript alerts or HTML elements.
5. Deployment: Deployed the application on a local web server or hosting platform, such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.

# Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the development of the Quiz Application Project:
